[Core bubble]()

For most people, their core bubble is their immediate household. An
immediate household is a group of people who live in the same residence.
For example:

-   If you have a rental suite in your home, the suite is a separate
    residence
-   If you live in an apartment or house with roommates, you are all
    members of the same household

For people who live alone, a core bubble is a maximum of two people you
see regularly.

 

[Co-parenting and legal parenting arrangements]()

The order does not impact arrangements where children are occupants of
two separate households. Children may go back and forth between the two

things like picking up children after school or delivering essential
items like mail, medication or groceries, these activities can continue.

 

[University students]()

Welcoming your child home from university is okay. This is not a social
gathering. 

 

Visiting people who live alone

People who live alone may have up to two visitors inside their
residence for a social purpose. These are the two people in your core
bubble.

    visit the residence of the person who lives alone at the same time

People who live alone may also visit one other residence with more than
one occupant.
